# LightHUD

My personal HUD aimed to be very minimal and light on performance, get's rid of many elements I don't personally feel the need of and with that brings a bit more stability with less freezes and some extra FPS.

Here are some of the screenshots, full album [HERE](../screenshots/showcase.md)
